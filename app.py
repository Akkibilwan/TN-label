CATEGORY_DEFINITIONS = """
* **Text-Dominant:** Large, bold typography is the main focus, covering a significant portion of the thumbnail. Minimal imagery or image is secondary. Goal: Grab attention with a compelling text hook.
* **Minimalist / Clean:** Uncluttered impression, simple background, limited color palette, clean font, few elements, lots of negative space. Goal: Appear modern, professional.
* **Face-Focused:** A close-up of a person's face showing clear emotion is the largest or most central element. Goal: Create human connection, convey emotion.
* **Before & After:** Clearly divided layout (usually vertically) showing two distinct states of the same subject/scene side-by-side. Goal: Demonstrate transformation or results.
* **Comparison / Versus:** Layout clearly structured (often split-screen) to visually place two or more competing items/ideas against each other. Goal: Highlight differences or choices.
* **Collage / Multi-Image:** Composed of multiple distinct images arranged together (grid, overlapping etc.). Goal: Hint at variety of content within the video.
* **Image-Focused:** A single, high-quality photograph, illustration, or graphic is the dominant element, carrying the visual appeal. Text is minimal/secondary. Goal: Impress with strong visuals.
* **Branded:** The *most defining characteristic* is the consistent and prominent use of specific channel logos, color schemes, or unique font styles that make it instantly recognizable *primarily* due to branding elements. Goal: Build brand recognition.
* **Curiosity Gap / Intrigue:** Deliberately obscures information using blurring, question marks, arrows pointing to something hidden, or incomplete visuals. Goal: Make the viewer click to find out more.
* **Other / Unclear:** Does not fit well into any of the above categories or combines multiple styles without a single dominant one.
